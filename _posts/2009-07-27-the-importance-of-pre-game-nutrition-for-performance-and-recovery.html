        <strong>Start 2 Days before game</strong><br/>Players should start their carbohydrate loading 2 days before
        match day.<br/>Carbohydrate is stored in the muscles as fuel called (glycogen) and it takes 24 - 48 hours for
        the muscle to be fully restored and recovered after exercise.<br/>Glycogen is the fuel burned in anaerobic
        activities. Anytime you are out of breath it is this store that is raided and if the store is empty you will run
        out of energy. Eating meat and no carbohydrates in the days before a performance is likely to cause you to run
        out of energy during the game. <br/><strong>Tips to maximise Carbohydrate store:</strong><br/>
        <blockquote><br/>
            <li><strong>Rest</strong>, no hard training sessions where the carbohydrate stores would be used as this
                would not leave enough time to re-fuel.<br/>Stretching routines are also a good idea.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Eat often </strong>every 2 - 4 hours will help load the muscle stores</li>
            <li><strong>Consume high carbohydrate foods</strong>: every meal should include bread, rice, pasta, fruit,
                and vegetables
            </li>
            <li><strong>Avoid new foods</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Avoid spicy or high fat foods </strong>they can slow digestion</li>
            <li><strong>Avoid alcohol </strong>24 hours before the game</li>
        </blockquote>
        <strong>Match Day Food </strong><br/>Wake up 5 hours before your game.<br/>All your energy for the game should
        already be stored in the muscles if you have eaten the right foods.<br/>Therefore large meals are unnecessary
        because any energy intake will not be able to be called upon during the same day.<br/>It is important to keep
        the blood sugar levels consistent during the game day.<br/><br/><strong>Therefore avoid foods
            like </strong><br/>
        <ul>
            <li>Chocolate Bars</li>
            <li>High sugar cookies</li>
            <li>Sweets</li>
            <li>High fibre muffins</li>
            <li>Beans</li>
        </ul>
        These cause a sudden increase in the blood sugar levels and, in response, the body produces insulin to bring
        these back down. The overall effect is that the blood sugar levels drop below the normal consistent level,
        making you feel tired, meaning you run out of energy before the end of the game. <strong>"This is known as the
            Mars bar effect"</strong> <br/><strong>Drink lots of water </strong>dehydration can cause depletion of
        muscle stores<br/><strong>Do eat easy to digest foods - </strong>High in carbohydrate, moderate fat and low in
        fibre<br/><strong> Therefore EAT foods like:</strong><br/>
        <ul>
            <li>Ripe bananas</li>
            <li>Yoghurt</li>
            <li>Sandwiches peanut butter lean ham</li>
            <li>Sports bar</li>
            <li>Sports drink</li>
            <li>Pasta</li>
        </ul>
        Coffee or tea is ok, as long as you drink plenty of water as well <br/>Your last meal should be consumed 2-4
        hours before your warm-up starts<br/>Suggestions towards your diet prior to the game include:<br/><strong>
            Breakfast : </strong>Bowl of cereal, fruit, toast peanut butter, juice <br/><strong>Lunch : </strong>Sandwich
        with, lean meat, fruit sports bar, water.<br/><strong>Rest of the time during build up before the match
            : </strong>1 - 2 litres of sports drinks to keep your blood sugar stable <br/><strong>The most important
            thing is to work out what works for you and make it part of your pre-game routine for every
            game.</strong><br/><br/><strong></strong><span style="font-size: 85%;"><strong>Original Author
