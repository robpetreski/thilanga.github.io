Today morning i wanted to listen some good music to fix my mood and i found Bisura album which i bought sometimes
ago. so i think this album really worked on me to fix my mood and it boosted up my energy back . however i'm a
fusion, Electronic music fan and most of the time i spent with AOL radio. so i belive that, i have a good taste in
this music and normally i don't listen Srilankan rock or Srilankan New age musics. but i saw the real sri lankan talent in this album.
