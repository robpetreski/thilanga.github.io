    <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Running&nbsp;a Developer Portal is not an easy task as I&nbsp;thought.
        When it comes to <a href="http://wso2.org/">WSO2 Oxygentank</a>&nbsp;It is more critical as WSO2&nbsp;community&nbsp;is
        heavily depend on the portal.<br/>

        <div><br/></div>
        <div>To be frankly if the site went offline for 1 minute, I used to get more than 20 email / &nbsp;IM chats or
            calls. Most of the solutions described in the web really didn't work for us. So we had to find our own way
            to stabilize the system. After spending so much of time configuring and tuning we ended up with a&nbsp;scalable&nbsp;and
            stable solution. In part <a
                    href="http://www.pitigala.org/2011/09/drupal-scaling-and-performance-tuning.html">1</a> and <a
                    href="http://www.pitigala.org/2011/10/drupal-scaling-and-performance-tuning.html">2</a>&nbsp;I have
            described methods which we used.
        </div>
        <div><br/></div>
        <div>During peak hours&nbsp;Our portal started to send 502 Bad&nbsp;gateway&nbsp;message from Nginx. The reason
            was due to mysql&nbsp;high-load in master 1 server, Nginx didn't&nbsp;receive&nbsp;the response with in
            defined time.&nbsp;</div>
        <div><br/></div>
        <div>Solution was we configured Nginx with backup nodes setting instead of setting up 4 nodes with weight
            balancing to handle the load.
        </div>
        <div><br/></div>
        <div><b>Sample nginx.conf</b></div>
        <div><b><br/></b></div>
        <div>
            <div>upstream wso2.org {</div>
            <div>&nbsp; &nbsp; server node1server:80 weight=5 fail_timeout=20s;</div>
            <div>&nbsp; &nbsp; server node2server.org:80 weight=5 fail_timeout=20s;</div>
            <div>&nbsp; &nbsp; server node3server:80 backup;</div>
            <div>&nbsp; &nbsp; server node4server:80 backup;</div>
            <div>&nbsp; }</div>
            <div style="font-weight: bold;"><br/></div>
        </div>
        <div>with this setup&nbsp;</div>
        <div>
            <ol style="text-align: left;">
                <li>Nginx&nbsp;always&nbsp;send traffic to node1 and node2 servers</li>
                <li>Primary&nbsp;data source is master1 mysql instance.</li>
                <li>Secondary data source is master2 MySQL instance</li>
            </ol>
            When node1 or node2&nbsp;couldn't&nbsp;response to Nginx with in 20 seconds we route the traffic to backup
            nodes
        </div>
        <div>
            <ol style="text-align: left;">
                <li>Nginx send traffic to node3 and node4 when node1 and node2 can not&nbsp;response&nbsp;</li>
                <li>Primary data source is master2 MySQL Instance</li>
                <li>Secondary data source is master1 MySQL instance</li>
            </ol>
            <div>with that setting we were able to keep the site with 0% downtime.</div>

            <div><br/></div>
            <div>Nginx&nbsp;always looked after load balancing when http/s traffic get high and with the backup node
                method we were able to keep our MySQL instance up and running without getting meltdown.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
